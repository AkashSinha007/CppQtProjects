1.QPainter : Logical Coordinates , Windows Coordinates
  QPaintDevice: Physical Coordinates , Viewport Coordinates
  
  Logical and Physical Coordinates are same by default.
  But they can be changed with below functions:
  Logical: setWindow()
  Physical: setViewPort()
  
2. The Only way to draw on QWidget is through paintEvent().
   But we can draw directly on Pixmap.
